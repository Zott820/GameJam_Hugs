Hug Strangers in the Park for Points - Created in Unity in 17 hours for the Vungle Game Jam


Original Proposal
============


A game where you have to give out hugs to people. In the style of 8-bit.

The player initially start out as a down on his luck person who lives in a decrepit apartment and is unwashed with flies.

The character is inspired to go out into the world and spread love through hugs. 
Initially in the player's unwashed state people will move away from the player.
Hugging them is a challenge. Hugging the same character twice will result in a harassment charge and the police showing up to take the player away. If they are caught they spend the night in jail and lose their hug progress. 

Unwanted hugging of certain risky individuals will lead to the player getting knocked out/stabbed, which results in much the same ending as being arrested. The rounds end after 2 minutes. The player will also be pushed away at the beginning, but their hugs will still count.

Getting hugs can be redeamed at the end of the day for bonuses. This is because at the end of the round, the player goes to their poor fast food job, and their current hug total reflects on their performance the next day. Some corresponding text gives them a description of their life philosophy. One new one for each day. 3 days with no hugs results in the player committing suicide and the game is over.

As the hug count increases, the performance at work increases, they get a better job, and they can buy more stuff for their home, even eventually buying a home, getting a wife and more.

Bonuses for hugging include:

1. Bath: 10% chance people won't run away from the player
2. New Clothes: 10% chance poeple won't run away from the player
3. Famous: Can hug people twice without a harassment people arriving.
4. Wife/Husband: Hugs people walking by on their own, bails player out of jail without loss of hugs. Hug too many women in a row and the wife will leave you. Same for a male husband.
5. 'Free Hugs' Sign: People will randomly approach the player for hugs.
6. Televisions Ads/notariaty: People will greatly approach the player for hugs.

After the player has attained celebrity status, their objective changes. They must now get from one side of the screen to the other. They have to hug past civilians who are bum-rushing him for a hug.
Every hug removes from his hug pool now. Some of the upgrades include body guards and other 'perks' that will push people away and defend the player from huggers.
